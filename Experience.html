        <h2> My valuable experience is running business. </h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p1> Although I sell someone else’s product, not my own product, it was still an experience that helped me think further and opened my perspective to many things. In the beginning, I became a dropship/agent for skincare products and it was a business that helped me in terms of knowledge and life. The first skincare product is Rsteamon, a local homemade skincare. With zero knowledge, I entered the field of business and was guided by my leader. A lot of knowledge I have gained and used when I was looking for sales. At the time, I was doing business quietly and only using my Instagram account to find customers. Even though I didn’t introduce myself, it wasn’t a barrier for me not to get sales. I try to find customers by contacting those who are interested in the comment space, which is indeed always there. I believe with that effort, there is sustenance for me. After running the business for 4 months, I have earned enough income to buy the goods I dream of, also gained knowledge and experience that is very valuable. </p1>

        <p2>For my second business is a skincare product as well, but the International product is Mary Kay. Because it is an interesting business and gives a lot of benefits to the beauty consultant (agent), I am interested to join. I am very grateful for the decision because this business opened my mind a lot and helped me explore my interests. Also, I learned a lot about skills such as Customer Service, Marketing, Personal Branding, Editing and more. With this business as well, I can find out my interest in editing and it has become one of my hobbies now. In this Mary Kay business as well, I started to stand out myself, the result of the knowledge of Personal Branding that I found in the beginning. </p2>

        <h4> No loss, just a feeling of gratitude. </h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p3> Overall, all the businesses that I join benefit me a lot in terms of education, experience and life. I dared myself to take risks and try new things in my life. Currently, I have another small business that sells Homemade Henna called Sahara and it has various colors, namely Black, Brown, Red and Maroon. I am the Agent for the business. While still with the Mary Kay business, I challenged myself to run another business, Henna, because I saw the opportunity and it would give me additional benefits. Alhamdulillah, so far it has gone well, despite the challenges, I tried to overcome them in a good way and asked for more opinion from the expert. With this, I appreciate my efforts and will do the best I can in the business so that it benefits all customers and also for me.</p3>
